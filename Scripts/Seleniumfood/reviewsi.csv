Individual Peach Cobblers,"Was just about to start this recipe when I saw that it called for ground flaxseed, to which I, like many people, am very allergic. Can you suggest a substitution such as, perhaps, oats? Or maybe a substitution isnâ€™t needed at all, it can just be eliminated.",4.3 of 5 stars
Individual Peach Cobblers,Can gluten free flour be used in place of all-purpose?,4.3 of 5 stars
Individual Peach Cobblers,Excellent!  Easy and delicious.  I used quick cook oats as well instead of flax seed.  Make this regularly now.,4.3 of 5 stars
Individual Peach Cobblers,"Healthy, easy AND delicious!! Next time I might try substituting xylitol for the sugar (which you'd use less than what the recipe calls for sugar or it'll be too sweet) and whole wheat pastry flour for some of the flour, just to make it even healthier. However, if you don't change anything the recipe is delicious!",4.3 of 5 stars
