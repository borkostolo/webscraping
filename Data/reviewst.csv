Tabbouleh,I love tabbouleh and was so excited to try this recipe but it was not good - the allspice gave it a really weird flavor that overpowered all of the over great ingredients. Won't make this again.,2 of 5 stars
Tabouli Salad,Awesome salad!!!!,5 of 5 stars
Tabouli Salad,"I did not have radishes, but put some red pepper in instead for color. I also added a little finely chopped mint and arugala because I hade some on hand....Otherwise followed recipe exactly. We loved it and will make it again.",5 of 5 stars
Tabouli Salad,I Love this Salad! Great Side dish I cant wait to make it again!!,5 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,great,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,"I did take the time to try it, but it's not really worth it. At all. Just make a regular taco ",2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,Mixing all ingredients was cool. Kids mixed what they liked in a bowl and then added to come and they enjoyed!,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,I would never waste my time making these when a taco is so much better. I agree with Anonymous and Liz J.'S reviews entirely. Beth Blair just sounded pretentious and judgmental.,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,Looks fun but wouldn’t the taco grease and salsa liquid run out of the hole in the bottom of the cone? Messy for sure!,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,We had a great time this. We mixed all the ingredients and added them to the cone and finished the top with an extra scoop of sour cream and cheese on top for sprinkles.  Really fun and cute idea.  Thanks!,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,"You know...while this is a very cute idea, the thing that makes no sense to me is that if you fill this taco with ""whatever"" it would be in layers unless you pre-mixed all the ingredients (taco salad). I mean who wants to take a bite of sour cream, then tomatoes, then lettuce, then cheese...etc.",2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,"I had exactly the same thought.  After reading the directions, I would add, what a lot of work and time for such a bad idea.  Ice cream cones work because all they hold is ice cream.  I have visions of whole bites of nothing but lettuce and meat filling spilling everywhere.  Oven baked shells are great for taco salads, but cone shaped tacos?  Not so much.",2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,What an awful recipe. If it is in anything but a corn tortilla it isn't a taco!,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,"That's what I thought too at first, but if you read through the whole recipe you'll see that the sugar cones are just used as a mold to wrap/shape the corn tortillas as they bake.  ",2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,"So, did you actually make this or is your opinion of this recipe based solely on your personal preference and not an experience with this recipe? ",2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,I think a corn tortilla slightly steamed and wrapped around and secured with a toothpick would work. But what a pain to go through all that when you don't need to. A waste of time when you could be eating perfectly good tacos... the way they are intended.,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Cones,My thoughts exactly. Tacos weren't meant to be eaten from a cone. ,2.6 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,this is the greatest EVER,3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,Sounds delicious.  I will probably make this,3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,"There are no BEANS in a taco so how can you call this a ""taco dip?""",3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,This is HGTV.  They can call it what they want.,3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,"This needed a LOT more flavor, it was very bland.  Some heat would help this dish, maybe some salsa or jalapeno peppers or both.",3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,Some New Mexico roasted Hatch green chilis for sure!,3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,"Taco Dip is easy to make and perfect for teenage get-togethers or sports events. I would season this a bit more, however. Also, we used ground turkey instead of ground beef. ",3 of 5 stars
Taco Dip,"ADD chopped fresh Cilantro, Thin sliced Scallions, and small slices of Avocado! YUM!",3 of 5 stars
Taco Lasagna,"This was a hit and I'll make it again but 1 lb of pasta is way too much - you only need 8 oz to do what is shown in the video. I dithered between using the whole 16 oz or what seemed more reasonable and went with 8 oz., which was perfect.",4.5 of 5 stars
Taco Lasagna,"I made this recipe tonight and it was so great! I did one spicy salsa and one medium spice salsa, added extra chile powder and also added in some garlic powder at the meat cooking stage. Overall this is a good base recipe to start with. Next time I think I will add jalapeños, red onion, cilantro, and avocado. Im even considering a bean and rice layer :)",4.5 of 5 stars
Taco Lasagna,"All good suggestions. But my husband can't eat onions, so I would leave those out. The bean and rice layer is a great idea! I love ranchero refried beans.",4.5 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,"This was a good simple recipe...not sure why they call it taco pie as there is no cumin or other taco seasoning in it, but it still managed to be a tasty dish.",3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,"This was very easy to make. I left out the cayenne pepper because my family is not big on spicy things, and I also left out the cheese because I am allergic to it. It was good and worth making and eating, but it is probably not something that I will make again.",3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,"Not bad. I added some Cumin and didn't have any cilantro so added some parsley. I also threw in some coarse ground black pepper. I'm thinking on the next batch I'll cook the tortillas a little longer so they're a bit more crunchy, and cook more then 8. 8 just didn't seem like enough.
Then we topped it with sour cream and hot sauce. I think a little avacado would complete the dish.",3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,"Quick, easy, tasty, this recipe has it all! I substituted some tortilla chips and leftover hard taco shells for the corn tortillas, a can of tomato sauce for the crushed tomatoes, and an equal volume of chopped poblanos for one of the cans of green chilis, because that's what I had on hand. And I served it topped with sour cream and avocado. My family loved it, and I'm putting it on my food calendar to make again next month. I LOVE the mildness of the pork in this recipe, compared to the usual ground beef (and I used a whole pound b/c that's what I had!",3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,"Very easy and quick. I did add a teaspoon of cumin, probably could have used 2 teaspoons. Otherwise, fine.",3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pie,Easy and definitely well be making again soon. Did add some Taco seasoning.,3.8 of 5 stars
Taco Pizza,"Haven't made this but I make something similar. Skip the beans and add chorizo. Use salsa brava in place of traditional pizza sauce, add sliced black olives to the toppings, and the rest pretty much as written.",4 of 5 stars
Taco Salad Bites,"Nice hearty appetizer, and easy, as advertised. With sour cream it was a little bland, so I used a little mild salsa instead, and served with sour cream and hot sauce on the side. For a once ounce meatball as stated in the recipe, needs more cooking time, but reduce heat so the chip doesn’t burn. About 15 minutes total time.",4 of 5 stars
Taco Seasoning,it was ok.,3.5 of 5 stars

Tacos Picadillo,Excellent!,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,Ive made this recipe a handful of times now. Very easy and delicious. Ive made slight modifications depending on what I've had in my pantry/fridge. I also like to use the tomato mixture for chicken and doing a shredded chicken taco.,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,This is recipe was so full of authentic Mexican flavor and simple enough to make during the weekday.,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,This really came out great! Frying your own taco shells is really worth it.,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,Really yummy! I added lime juice at the end too. It tasted so much better than just opening up my usual taco seasoning packet and claiming I made tacos. Won't go back to that way again we will eat these tacos from now on.,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,"Fantastic! I hate packaged taco seasoning, and now I don't have to use it!!
The only thing I changed was I used poblano peppers instead of jalapeno. I didn't have any, and I love poblanos... also, didn't feel like making shells in 90 degree heat, so I used boxed.",4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,"Tried for the first time last night and was very happy with it.Ive been experimenting with different ways to avoid the packet stuff and this is one of the best.I was a little sketchy about the heat factor cuz my girl thinks black pepper is spicy,but it was not a problem and she enjoyed them as much as the rest of us.The only thing i changed was i browned the beef with the onions,drained,then added the seasonings.I used fresh tomatoes too.Also i added 1\2 teaspoon each of ancho and chipotle chile powder.My first five star rating on food network!!",4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,Really great tacos. I love the flavor and not at all greasy! Adding Taco Tuesdays to my week!,4.6 of 5 stars
Tacos Picadillo,WOW!!! The flavor is like no other. This recipe is the best. I used ground beef and it was amazing. I will never cook ground beef any other way than this one. The flavor is intense and the meat is so juicy and flavorful. It is a definite keeper and a meal to be cooked more often than not. Thanks Food Network.,4.6 of 5 stars

Take-to-School Taco Bar,"This such an excellent idea! Unfortunately so many schools are serving unhealthy foods, ex. hamburgers made from ""pink slime."" I have had so many kids and teens tell how school meals are disgusting, so they do not eat. Kids are in schools during their two most important meals; breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm sure your child(ren would appreciate a homemade meal and the notes, such a nice personal touch.",5 of 5 stars
