Preparation of spuds...initially, I followed the recipe's instructions. I kept cutting through the potato while slicing! After many trials...I used some common kitchen tools: chop sticks and butter slicers!
After prepping the potatoes, I put two chop sticks on the cutting board...placed the potato between...then used the butter slicer to slice even-width slices to the chop sticks. Works every time...for me!

1404,none,Easy,BLT Tomatoes,4.0,40.0,"OK, here's how I changed this recipe for better results...

1. After hollowing out the four tomatoes, I saved the tomato ""guts"" and, after chopping them into smaller pieces, ran them vigorously through our salad spinner. I dumped the liquid, then spun them again to keep the moisture content as minimal as possible. These were the first ingredient added to the mixing bowl for the ""stuffing,"" and I salted them well with coarse sea salt to bring out their flavor while they rest.

2. The idea of frying bacon with garlic seems kind of silly to me (though I can't say for sure, because I've never tried it), and wouldn't the whole dish be more flavorful with some baked garlic all around? So, instead of cooking the bacon slices with a garlic clove, I decided to add chopped garlic to the mixing bowl for the ""stuffing."" Garlic mellows when it is baked and we love garlic, so I actually added two well-chopped cloves to the mix.

3. Leave out the lettuce.

4. Mix up the well-spun, salted tomato ""guts"" with the chopped bacon, chopped garlic, bread cubes, mayo, salt and pepper. Stuff your tomato shells, brush with the bacon drippings, and bake.

5. Don't eat these when they are scaldingly-hot. There is no flavor whatsoever, even if your mouth can handle extreme temperature. Either let the tomatoes rest for about ten minutes before serving, or cut the very hot tomatoes open a bit to let them cool for about five minutes, to what I would call ""very warm""--above room temperature, but not too hot. The flavors really seem to emerge as these stuffed tomatoes cool slightly ...But don't eat these cold, either. The many layers of flavors are a bit elusive, so give it a try on the warm side, and let it cool a little more if your taste buds aren't enjoying the dish yet :)

Last, we are thinking to add a bit more to this mix when we try it again, maybe some cut up rotisserie chicken?",3.3

3418,,,Cafeteria Sloppy Joes,,,"there's a reason why these are called cafeteria sloppy joes bc they taste like it. next time I'll just use Ree Drummond's recipe.
