Deep-Fried Green Beans,"I can't believe this recipe was tested and approved by professional chefs. I followed the recipe exactly, even made some modifications on the original that didn't ""work"" and couldn't keep the batter/coating on the beans so they would fry crisp. It's like a very important step is missing...",2.6 of 5 stars
Deep-Fried Green Beans,"i used goat milk (gotta use what's handy on a farm) and a corn meal mix (instead of just 'cornmeal'), dry dredge as per recipe and it was great.... i'm just sad there isn't a dipping sauce to go w/ this... so i guess i will experiment, but i figure there will be more cayenne in it!",2.6 of 5 stars
Deep-Fried Green Beans,"When making this recipe as directed, the cornmeal falls off the beans into the oil for an inferior result. Here is how to remedy it: Instead of tossing the beans in buttermilk and dredging in cornmeal, mix the buttermilk with the seasoned cornmeal to make a wet batter. Dredge the green beans in flour, then coat them in the wet cornmeal-buttermilk mixture. Fry as directed. This will give you a bean coated in a thick, crispy batter.",2.6 of 5 stars

Deep-Fried Green Beans,"Don't waste your time, money, and ingredients. I made this recipe to the l-e-t-t-e-r and the result was disasterous. The tasteless cornmeal ended up on the bottom of the pan. It fell off of the beans as soon as the beans were put into the oil. No way to fix this mess. Makes pretty good birdfeed tho.",2.6 of 5 stars
Delilah's Chocolate Surprise,"I've made this cake for several family functions, and it's always a hit - especially w/ some low fat vanilla ice cream. It's not too sweet, and just chocolately enough, and the orange gives it a little hint of a ""surprise"". Love it!!",5 of 5 stars

Detroit-Style Pizza,For some the convenience of refrigerated pizza dough works well. Not everyone can always make their own. Thankful for options. Sad so many negative comments.,2.5 of 5 stars
Detroit-Style Pizza,This is a really good pizza. Maybe not a true Detroit pizza. But it's really good.,2.5 of 5 stars
Detroit-Style Pizza,"I’ve made this 3 times for three different people and we loved it. I get that it’s not traditional Pizza and that’s ok because I like the change once in a while. I know people are also saying it didn’t taste like Detroit Pizza. I can’t say because I’ve never had it before. Give this a shot, it was tasty.",2.5 of 5 stars
Detroit-Style Pizza,"I receive daily emails from the Food Network with the day's featured recipe. When the recipe catches my attention, I click on the link to check it out. This Detroit pizza recipe caught my attention because the email blurb enticed me with ""Put down the pizza stone and grab your metal pan, because those crispy edges and that spongy dough await."" I clicked the link to read the recipe. So when I looked at the first ingredient and saw that it was store bought pizza dough, I was in disbelief. Talk about bait and switch! Shame on you Food Network.",2.5 of 5 stars

Detroit-Style Pizza,"We lived in Detroit for 30 years and had MANY, MANY Buddy's Pizza (rarely Shield's).  I've never attempted to duplicate it -- need those treasured pans to get that perfect crust.  Also, one of the main cheeses used is BRICK - that's the variety (not the shape) and I can't locate it anywhere near me in Florida.",2.5 of 5 stars
Detroit-Style Pizza,"I grew up in MIchigan and lived in Detroit for many years.  I never heard of Detroit pizza.  What is it supposed to be ( ingredients) and where was it ""born.""",2.5 of 5 stars
Detroit-Style Pizza,"Does sound something like making a sort of bread bowl with a lot of poor excuse for tomato soup to fill up the bowl. 28 ounces of tomato, plus paste???.  Personally I always make my own dough, some times a rich dough, other times a lean dough more like one would use for French bread.  For sauce, I found that small can of Hunts tomato sauce (enough for 3 medium pizzas) with herbs, great over the store bought jarred, but here I warm the sauce and add a bit more flavor with some bullion flavor, depending on the toppings. some more added dried spices, like Mexican or other culture for the taste I want. Note: while the sauce is warming to blend in additives,  I use a pinch of baking Soda to neutralize tomato acid, no heart burns.    The sauce is use sparingly.  One thing I found that Pepperoni can be very oily, so I warm it on a paper towel to degrease before putting I on as a topping.
