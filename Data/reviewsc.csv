Cabbage Soup,"Great soup. Followed the recipe the first time. The second time I added beans and potatoes and kicked up the spices a bit to my liking. Also, put some baby spinach at the bottom of my bowl and poured the soup over it for something different. To add, I used Savoy cabbage.",4.4 of 5 stars

Cabbage Soup,This was fantastic! Cooking the veggies added so much flavor. I didn’t have a big enough soup pot so I ended up adding them to the crock pot for an hour or two on high to blend the flavors.,4.4 of 5 stars

Cacio e Pepe Pasta,My question also. NO GARLIC?,5 of 5 stars
Cacio e Pepe Pasta,There is never any recipe written in stone. If you want to add garlic add garlic. I've also added a touch of white wine during the butter and oil process,5 of 5 stars

Cacio e Pepe with Peas,Will make again my husband liked this dish a lot. Used the cheeses it called for and the taste was terrific. Follow the recipe and always taste to your liking,3 of 5 stars
Cacio e Pepe with Peas,"It was ok, but not great. I appreciate that the peas are there to add a little protein and a vegetable, so I felt good about making this for my family. The flavor was good, but not great. I'm sure this is because I wasn't using the same quality cheeses or as much fat as restaurants use when making this dish. So it's a healthy, easy make-at-home option, but not as flavorful as I expect cacio e pepe to be.",3 of 5 stars
Cadbury Deviled Eggs,"I am not very creative and these actually turned out like the picture. Cutting the eggs and getting the fondant out without breaking them was the hardest part. Definitely don't use anything larger than a paring knife and warm it often. I think if I made these again I might just buy hollow chocolate eggs and fill with frosting or make another grenache. There will little bits of dark chocolate that I couldn't help but get in the grenache, so I did put the grenache thorugh a strainer after microwaving and before chilling. All in all, a do again for a cute Easter dessert/decoration. ",4 of 5 stars
Cadbury Deviled Eggs,this just may be way too sweet especially because white chocolate is too sweet. Why not use cream cheese to cut the sweetness?,4 of 5 stars
Caesar Chicken Wings,"Nasty, disgusting, not even sensible...bake then coat in Mayo Dressing(not even Ceaser's)...then re-dip in the same soggy mess....gross",1 of 5 stars

Caesar Salad,"The ingredients were great, but I had no clue on how much to add of what. I ended up combining these ingredients and Rachel Ray''s. This recipe I added 1 egg yolk, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 container of anchovies, 2 tablespoons of worcestershire, 1 tbs. lemon juice, s/p to taste, and 4 tbs of mayo! That was the key...mayo.",3 of 5 stars

Caesar Salad,OMG! Delish. Having kosher people for dinner and this tastes like it has cheese in it.,3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,Outstanding!  And so simple. ,3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,That was AWESOME. I just had it for lunch. So I reduced the olive oil by a couple tablespoons and the bit of water left on the romaine lettuce served to slightly thin the dressing. My garlic cloves were substituted for a bit of shallot finely chopped and garlic salt. I made croutons out of a couple slices of stalish seed bread; olive oil as I had no butter on hand to saute with. I added some fresh cold red grapes into the salad to balance flavours. YUM!!! - Vancouver Canada.,3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"A welcome, quick dressing rather than than the usual raw/pasteurized egg version.  Like others, reduced garlic, but added worcestershire and  lemon juice. Actually next time I'll try Ree Drummond's version; seems to hit all the flavors.",3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"I am sorry to say my experience with this dressing was subpar. I followed the directions to a ""T"" and what I got was a watery, yellow fluid. Did anyone notice the lack of Worcestershire sauce that the original recipe calls for? It's for the umami flavor. I had to add more oil, mayonnaise, mustard and anchovy paste and even then it was better but not what I wanted still. I think these people at Food Network need to go back and rework this recipe and get it right. ",3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"6 cloves of garlic is way too much, the dressing was overpowering. That being said, I made it into a larger batch and increased the amount of the other ingredients used to nullify the powerful garlic taste. With this alteration the dressing was spot on and my parents loved the salad!
One other thing that wasn't quite right was how oily the croutons were, I think three tablespoons may be too much butter. 4/5 stars with alterations.",3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"Agreed on the 6 cloves of garlic-- wayyyy too much and I love garlic! Didn't have the same trouble with the croutons, though... Mine actually came out quite dry (AKA crouton-y! haha) using the amounts listed. Did you use the whole baguette?",3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"I made a few additions and changes to it and it worked out perfectly. So much so that it's all my 6 1/2 year old son would eat, he had 3 servings of salad for dinner. 

2-3 cloves garlic minced (reduced from 6)
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon anchovy paste
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon vinegar
Pinch kosher salt (1/2 a tsp about)
Fresh ground black pepper
- mix well
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- mix again
1/2 cup olive oil - add in slowly and emulsify until creamy.",3.8 of 5 stars
Caesar Salad,"Love this dressing! I've customized it to a vegan version by simply not adding the minced anchovies and using veganaise instead. The dressing is great! I love the garlicky taste - I have customized it a bit more by adding a bit of minced capers from another recipe and that was great too! I'm just curious as to how long it will last ? I seem to use it up so fast and I hate doing dishes lol I would love if I could make a few days or a week's worth at a time without it spoiling, love this recipe!",3.8 of 5 stars

Cafeteria Sloppy Joes,"there's a reason why these are called cafeteria sloppy joes bc they taste like it. next time I'll just use Ree Drummond's recipe. I hate the apple cider vinegar kinda overpowering tried adding some salt and extra ketchup didnt help much. tried adding some extra sugar too. not to mention this recipe is pretty vague in itself like it doesnt say how high the heat should be or maybe how big the onion should be. should i drain the fats or no? just elaborate a little more

Cafeteria Sloppy Joes,I was surprised! I've been many homemade Sloppy Joe's but I love this one. I was going to replace the ketchup with tomato sauce but I'm really glad I didn't. Yummy. Might had some veggies to it next time :,4.6 of 5 stars

Cajun Cabbage Skillet,"This is so much more delicious than you would think! I made some alterations to make the dish vegan (I've been vegetarian for a couple of decades but make meals vegan when possible). I used Tofurkey ""Andouille,"" added celery and bell pepper when I sauteed the onion, and added some homemade Cajun spice mix (from ""Sweet Potato Soul"") because the veg sausage doesn't release a lot of liquid. I served the cabbage over a little bit of plain white rice. It's insanely delicious (""can't pass the skillet without taking a bite"" delicious). The veggies were on their last legs, and made an incredible dish! I'm sure the recipe is great as written as well!",4.9 of 5 stars

Cajun Chicken with Pinto Beans,Fantastic. Became an instant family favorite. It's one of those gems that you're happy to have discovered in the food network magazine. ,5 of 5 stars
Cajun Chicken with Pinto Beans,"This one's a keeper for sure! My toddler even gobbled up the chicken, saying ""mmm, yummy!"" My only suggestion would be to add a pinch of salt to the chicken with the Cajun seasoning because it needed a touch more flavor (could have been the brand of Cajun seasoning I bought though). Oh and a side of crusty bread to mop up the amazing sauce!",5 of 5 stars
Cajun Chicken with Pinto Beans,didn't pour off any of the bacon grease in the pan and cooked the chicken right in it and then finished in the oven. absolutely delicious. better than i expected!,5 of 5 stars
Cajun Chicken with Pinto Beans,I doubled the recipe and my family has been eating it for the last three nights. I could not find sofrito but just skipped that ingredient. Next time I will make sure to visit our local latino food store. But was still an amazing dish. Made ChiChis cornbread as a side and was a perfect complement. I made dinner last night to find my daughter reheating the last of the leftovers of this dish because she did not want to waste it.,5 of 5 stars
