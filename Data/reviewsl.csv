Ladyfingers,"I was having a hard time finding ladyfingers to make tiramisu so I finally decided to check what was involved in making them from scratch. This recipe turned out great and was pretty easy. I didn't have a pastry bag so I just used a gallon zip lock with a pastry tip coupler (also didn't have a half inch pastry tip which worked fine. I forgot to add the powdered sugar before baking, and found that 20 minutes was just right. My ladyfingers were 3-4"" long and the recipe yielded 100.",5 of 5 stars

Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"YUM! I followed recipe with a small twist since I was not doing the corn...Started roasting some Brussels sprouts in a 435 (tossed with olive oil, s/p) about 15 minutes before I was ready to put the chicken in the oven. After browning chicken, I placed the garlic and a rosemary sprig in the pan with sprouts, stirred the lemon zest/juice into the skillet with a good amount of broth. I place the chicken atop the garlic and poured sauce all over and placed in oven for 20 minutes. Beautiful flavors and the Brussels paired so well with this sauce. ",4.8 of 5 stars

Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"After my husband's first bite he said, ""Amazing!  Where is this recipe from?  Make sure to save it.""  My son doesn't really like to eat fresh corn off the cob.  He said, 
""Mom.  I like corn this way best.""  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  I don't always take the time to enter comments on the recipes I try, but this was really good and I know I will  make it again. (Love it when my family all likes a recipe!)",4.8 of 5 stars
Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"Wonderful, easy meal! A bit too much lemon for my family but that's personal taste. The technique and cooking time were perfect. This was my first at creamed corn, used 2% that we had on hand and everyone enjoyed.",4.8 of 5 stars
Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"This meal was phenomenal! We absolutely loved it! After cooking the chicken in the skillet, I transferred the chicken to a baking dish because I made a double batch and did not have two ovenproof skillets; it still turned out wonderful! Also, I replaced the whole milk with the same amount of original soymilk because I have a severe milk allergy, and it tasted amazing! It was my first time to ever have creamed corn, and I loved it! The pairing of the flavors in the chicken with the flavors in the corn was perfection! This will definitely be a new go-to meal for my family!",4.8 of 5 stars

Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"This recipe is supreme and one that I have gone back to several times! The creamed corn is a cinch to make and delicious. I used 2% milk and a bag of golden and white corn mix. I have to tell you my family, who happens to be very picky, ate every bit of this meal. We also had a green salad on the side!",4.8 of 5 stars

Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"Great recipe. Made it several times already and will keep it for sure. I don't like to use oven during the summer when it is hot and a/c is working non-stop. So, tried to make it in skillet. It was good too.",4.8 of 5 stars
Lemon-Garlic Chicken With Creamed Corn,"Tasty and simple. note: I added some chicken broth just before sticking the skillet into the oven, just to give it some liquid. Also left the lemon halves in the skillet while roasting",4.8 of 5 stars

Lemon-Garlic Shrimp and Grits,AMAZING,4.6 of 5 stars
Lemon-Garlic Shrimp and Grits,Instant Grits or Quick cooking Grits? I used instant grits twice now-following the individual packet instructions to cook the grits. Prepared the rest of the recipe as described-and so delicious. Brave enough to experiment with other reviewers’ suggestions now that I know this is a keeper recipe.,4.6 of 5 stars
