Jalapeno Cornbread,"This is by far the best cornbread recipe I've found. I'm from the south, and I know if cornbread is good or not. It's easy to make and very light and tasty. Mine was not dry as stated in another comment. I make it about once a week and serve it with chili or with various kinds of beans or peas. It's also awesome with soups and stews.",4.3 of 5 stars

Jalapeno Cornbread,"Dry dry dry. When someone looks for a -jalapeno- recipe they want it to be hot, with a punch and lots of flavor. It was not good. I should have known better when I saw that the recipe was written the way it was-very sloppy not like the other recipes that have an ingredient part and then the instructions.",4.3 of 5 stars
Jalapeno Cornbread,"Very easy recipe with great results. I think the buttermilk is the secret to this cornbread. Came out PERFECT! Moist, fluffy, raised up real nice, and no burnt edges. Next time I will try it with a little grated cheddar mixed in. I highly recommend this recipe for the beginner or seasoned chef.",4.3 of 5 stars
