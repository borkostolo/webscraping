Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"Oh I promise I will never make turkey gravy any other way again ! This is delicious, a huge time saver and if you want, you can always add some of the drippings from your bird. The depth of flavor is amazing because of the roasting of the wings and drumstick meat. So good !",4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"Amazing! Used 6 cups of

Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"I made this today, the flavor is outstanding! I’ll make turkey gravy any other way! It’s a real time saver.",4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,Just finished making this gravy the Tuesday before Thanksgiving! It is awesome! I plan to add it to my turkey drippings on Thursday. Thank you kitchen crew for this awesome recipe!,4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,I caught the end of The Kitchen broadcast where Katie Lee made what she called “my make ahead turkey gravy”. So I found this recipe and used it. Then today I saw a rebroadcast of the show and saw Katie making it from the beginning. SHE DID NOT USE THIS RECIPE! Vegetables? Worschester sauce? Sherry vinegar? Great ideas! Just wish this recipe actually included them!,4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"This gravy is amazing. I used 4 turkey wings and roasted as per the recipe. I did cut down on the broth to 6 cups. Best turkey gravy I've had, and without the hastle of making last minute with guests waiting. Thanks so much for the recipe, will be my go-to every year.",4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"I've made this recipe several times, and it's a great recipe. However, I use 6 cups of chicken broth. 8 cups is way too much liquid. Using 6 cups of broth, you will end up with 4 cups of perfect gravy! Also, I roast 1 or 2 turkey legs, which the butcher cuts into pieces for me.  ",4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,Do you think this can be made with store bought chicken broth?,4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,I loved this recipe and will not go back to the last minute rush of needing to stir gravy while my hands are needed for everything else.  I am not one who needs to have very thick gravy but I might add a bit of cornstarch and reserved chicken broth when warm it up.  I LOVED the flavor.,4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,"I followed this recipe exactly and something is wrong with the recipe as written.  Too much broth for the flour mixture.  You'll note that it calls for 8 cups of stock, yet yields 4 cups of gravy.    Where the heck did all the liquid stock go?  It didn't disappear with 30 minutes of simmering.   I just looked at a similar recipe on this site - 8 cups of stock = 8 cups of gravy.  ",4.4 of 5 stars
Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy,The recipe produced a tasty and rich gravy. It was also easy to make.,4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"good brownies but aren't they all? They weren't amazing, but they were good.",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"These brownies take 20 minutes to make and are showstoppers! I didn't find them eggy at all. They came out great after cooling completely in pan. I used semi sweet chocolate chips and didn't even chop the chocolate- just melted it in a double boiler. It looks like a lot of cream cheese topping, but after you marble it in it's just right.",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"i made these for my girlfriend's family for the christmas holidays. they all loved them, so much so that they are getting me to make them some more for new year's eve tonight. i will say though that the cream cheese doesnt seem to stand out very much. its a very subtle cream cheese flavor. still, very good.",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,Yummy! I made these brownies yesterday with my 12 year old son and they were easy to make and tasted so good. Only one brownies remaining after one day!,4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,great Recipe,4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"My brownie batter was very thick, but the overall result was super yummy!",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"These brownies are fool proof and I made some foolish mistakes. I forgot to turn the heat off once the chocolate melted, added the dry ingredients BEFORE the chocolate mixture, and over nuked the cream cheese so that it went from softened to soupy and these brownies still turned out great!! I baked for 35 minutes and the consistency was perfect! I added pecans to the chocolate mixture and these brownies are rich, decadent, and delicious!",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"At first, I found this recipe to be pretty ""eggy"" as well, and was surprised. I thought maybe there was too much of the cream cheese mix. But, I found that after a few more minutes in the oven (parchment paper helps prevent the edges from burning) and after cutting them up, they set up very nicely later. So, I think this treat is best after letting them sit a while and COMPLETELY cool. After that, they don't taste eggy at all, and are VERY good! My husband is not much of a brownie fan, but he loved this one.",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,"These brownies are very tasty and moist. I actually forgot the sugar in the cream cheese part, and I don't think it took away from the flavor at all. The only problem I had was the batter was very thick, so it was difficult to mix the cream cheese with the brownie batter.",4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Brownies,I made these for my hubby and he loved them. I will be making these again and again. Thanks so much Food Network!,4.4 of 5 stars
Marbled Mashed Sweet Potatoes,"Tasted great , although I'm not sure what the point is, we did really like it",5 of 5 stars
Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,"Definitely a family favorite! I have made it several times to the letter of the recipe. This last time, I used one large russet and cut in half, and a medium sweet potato for the both of us. Works just as well!",4.9 of 5 stars
Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,These came out perfect! Worth all of the hardwork :-) especially how the writing on my oven knobs are worn off so it's difficult determining the oven degrees. My husband loved!!!!!!!!,4.9 of 5 stars
Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,"This is a good way to make twice-baked potatoes more healthy. I hate sweet potatoes, but thought they added just enough extra flavor.",4.9 of 5 stars
Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,"OMG this is amazingly yummy! After I made them as twice baked potatoes, I decided to just make it as a potato casserole for a family get together. Everyone loved it! MY husband has now told me that these are his favorite potatoes ever and has asked me to make it for his family at their next holiday get together!",4.9 of 5 stars
Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,These are a little bit of work but are delisiso!. I am not a huge sweet potato fan but my dad is so I made this recipe to have the best of both worlds and a little added extra with the cheese! They are worth the work and heat up well with a little butter if you have some leftovers.,4.9 of 5 stars

Marbled Stuffed Potatoes,FABULOUS!!!!!!! I cut each potato in half and used greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Best twiced baked potato I have EVER Made! Love Them!,4.9 of 5 stars

Margarita,Made one. Wasn't our fav. We doctored the one until we got it to where it was ok. Was making for a guest - I'm a tried and true Trudy's Mexican Martini kind of gal. ,4.7 of 5 stars
Margarita,"I made these for a Mexican dinner and they were absolutely delicious!  My daughter introduced me to this recipe a couple of years ago but she didn’t bother with the salt mixture.  I followed the recipe exactly, including the lime-salt-sugar for “frosting” the glasses’ rims, and my daughter agreed that prepared this way, the drinks were truly spectacular.  I wish I had one in my hand right now!  ",4.7 of 5 stars

Margarita,"I made margaritas following this recipe. They came out really good, although for me they were a little strong (but I am a lightweight). Next time I will cut the tequila to 2oz, and use only 1/2 tsp. of the orange liquor. Otherwise, pretty tasty margaritas.",4.7 of 5 stars
