"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal",Love it! I added a little sweetened shredded coconut& a piece of Ibarra mexican chocolate to sweeten it up. Perfect,4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal","Hey, I really loved but one thing it wasn’t very sweet (not your fault) so I added a little more sugar and a tiny bit more of vanilla. But good job I give 5 stars",4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal","Delicious and fast! (Probably faster than the recipe notes.) Perfect thickness. I skipped the extra chocolate chips and it was sweet enough for me. I didn't have almond extract lying around so I just added a little bit more vanilla extract and it worked great. I'm not a fan of walnuts so I used almonds instead, but they were a bit too crunchy in context so I would stick to something like walnuts or pecans! I also added chia seeds which worked great. Definitely making this one again! ",4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal","Very good, simple and fast.  As someone else noted, I added the extracts (little more vanilla than called for) after adding the oats to make sure the flavor didn't get lost.   I put all the banana in with the liquid so it would act as an extra sweetener (smashing it up as it cooked).  I used agave instead of honey.  FYI, really overripe bananas are very sweet.  I freeze whole bananas that most people would want to toss.  I just let them warm up slightly to get the peel off and smash it into the oatmeal.  I sprinkled cinnamon toasted walnuts (no extra cinnamon beyond that) and mini-chips on top and also drizzled some almond butter on as well.  No extra sweetener needed by my teens.  Modify to your tastes!",4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal",Needed more steps on how to make it. I'm not a good cook by far but I get by with easy stuff. Wife helped. Kids loved it and it was a good change to our breakfast. ,4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal","Was great - not as sweet as I like, but that could be just me. I had to cook longer than 7 minutes to get to be less watery. I think I'll add the extracts in at the end to get more flavor out of them.",4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal",Yummy! Easy! I cut the recipe in half and added I tblsp. peanut butter. I didn't want it too chocolatey so I didn't add the chips at the end. Also substituted agave for the honey and added a little more then the recipe called for.,4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal",This recipe was a nice change in my breakfast routine. I think the chocolate chips are essential to the recipe! I ended up adding another banana and peanut butter while I ate it throughout the week.,4.5 of 5 stars
"""Hot Chocolate"" Banana-Nut Oatmeal","We really enjoyed this. I didn't have plain almond milk or almond extract so I used my unsweetened vanilla almond milk and doubled the vanilla. As my husband does not like nuts I left the almonds out altogether and just added the walnuts to mine at the end. Also, I did not have honey so I ended up using Agave nectar. In the end, I added extra chocolate chips to my husbands as he is a sweeter the better kind of guy although I was fine with the more mild sweetness of the dish.",4.5 of 5 stars

Ham and Cheese Quick Bread,"Why does the recipe say inactive time 1 hr, 25 min?",4.7 of 5 stars
Ham and Cheese Quick Bread,"With or without the glaze, it's delicious! I do prefer the glaze though.",4.7 of 5 stars
Ham and Cheese Quick Bread,"This is a great bread. I doubled the recipe and followed the bread portion exactly, except that I didn't have any scallions, so I added 1 tsp. onion powder (for two loaves). I used the glaze, and although I was leery because I thought it would be too sweet, I think it MAKES the bread. I added a hefty pinch of kosher salt and about a tablespoon of bacon fat to my glaze, let it boil for a minute, then poured it over the bread; the sweet/saltiness is to die for with the bread's crust. Don't skip it!",4.7 of 5 stars

Ham and Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breasts,I LOVE this recipe! My boyfriend and I are on a budget and with work you just want something easy and filling. The chicken is juicy and the ham/provolone mustard tastes great. I served it with some roasted broccoli and salad.,5 of 5 stars
Ham and Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breasts,"I've been making chicken Cordon Bleu for 30 years to much acclaim, but this dish was easier, lower calorie, much faster and VERY tasty. So long Cordon Bleu. Hello this chicken way!
Now, to try some of the other stuffed chicken recipes I found.
NOTE: What with the plumping of America and the subsequent plumping of chicken breasts, these sliced and stuffed breasts are a real find. They cook through and remain tender.",5 of 5 stars
