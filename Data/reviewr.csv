"""Really"" Onion Dip",Try Ina Garten's Pan-Fried Onion Dip (recipe available at this website). It is by far an easier recipe than this with awesome results. I will never buy store bought or use the onion soup mix/sour cream again.,2.9 of 5 stars
"""Really"" Onion Dip",This receipe is a lot of work but worth EVERY bit. This is the best Onion Dip I have ever tasted. The fried onions on to add a little zing to a wonderful dip. Our family all loved it and wanted the receipe. I wouldn't change a single thing. We will have this again and again.,2.9 of 5 stars
"""Really"" Onion Dip","After reading all the other reviewers comments, I used 1 cup of Miracle Whip (I prefer it instead of mayo), tasted it, & added about 1/4 cup more. I liked it, but my husband did not. He would have rather had the dried onion mix mixed with the sour cream. He said it might have been better with mayo. Will not make it again.",2.9 of 5 stars
"""Really"" Onion Dip","The dip took a long time to make, and was not good at all. Lipton's onion soup mix and sour cream is 50 times better and easier.

The consistency was weird, and flavor not great. If you are going to eat something that high fat, it should at least taste good.",2.9 of 5 stars

"""Really"" Onion Dip","It does take a little bit of time to make this dip however every time I have made it, I have gotten RAVE reviews from everyone who has tried it.

"""Really"" Onion Dip",Can I please have some onion with my mayonaisse? I foolowed the recipe. Had to make a few adjustments! About a 3rd of a cup of mayo and three times as much sour cream. Then this was edible.,2.9 of 5 stars
"""Really"" Onion Dip","This dip is sooo worth the work. You have got to try it!!! People will go nuts over this one. The onions that are caramelized in the olive oil are like onion candy. Use large sweet onions instead---- sooo good! If you're a french onion dip lover... this dip will win your heart! Thanks Food Network!!Love, Ces.",2.9 of 5 stars
