BBQ Duck on Corn Cakes,"This appetizer has become a stapple at my dinner parties. Especially when I want to do something fancy. There is a few modifications you can make to really simply this. I use a corn bread mix where all you need to do is add water, comes out just as well as homemade and so much easier. I use a store bought good bbq sauce, why make you own there is so many good ones out there. To decorate cakes at end, I add a small dolop of creme fraische on top of duck and sprinkle with chives. It's a winner.",4 of 5 stars

I recommend using less thyme because it is very powerful....I also used miracle whip instead of mayo and low fat sour cream, for all those complaining about calories and fat content....I also used almost double the amount of noodles, this distributed the mix well, making less calorie content per serving. I also switched the lettuce for baby spinach and did not mix into bowl, I put the spinach with the noodles as I served it.......I will be making this again and again....it will be a hit at parties...this I can guarantee.....",3.9 of 5 stars

BLT Tomatoes,"I thought BLT tomatoes sounded great and they were! I made some minor changes based on other reviews and on what I had on hand; my lettuce of choice was baby spinach, I added a couple of scallions I needed to use up, I added Parmesan cheese (to hold the stuffing together and because I love cheese.), I used panko bread crumbs because that's what I had, and I added the chopped garlic to the stuffing. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to add the tomato flesh to the stuffing but I did chop and add it. It's was delicious, the texture was perfect, not a sloppy mess at all! I made it as a side to a pork loin and all I wanted was the tomato!",3.3 of 5 stars
BLT Tomatoes,"My go to baked tomato recipe. I'm not sure why the others rated it so low? Perhaps they used iceberg lettuce. Use romaine; even after baking it is still crunchy, but caramelized from baking. I am vegan so use smoked almonds in lieu of the bacon and used homemade croutons in the place of the stale bread.",3.3 of 5 stars
BLT Tomatoes,We Loved it! Instead of using stale bread cubes I used Panko Bread Crumbs!,3.3 of 5 stars
BLT Tomatoes,"OK, here's how I changed this recipe for better results...

1. After hollowing out the four tomatoes, I saved the tomato ""guts"" and, after chopping them into smaller pieces, ran them vigorously through our salad spinner. I dumped the liquid, then spun them again to keep the moisture content as minimal as possible. These were the first ingredient added to the mixing bowl for the ""stuffing,"" and I salted them well with coarse sea salt to bring out their flavor while they rest.

2. The idea of frying bacon with garlic seems kind of silly to me (though I can't say for sure, because I've never tried it), and wouldn't the whole dish be more flavorful with some baked garlic all around? So, instead of cooking the bacon slices with a garlic clove, I decided to add chopped garlic to the mixing bowl for the ""stuffing."" Garlic mellows when it is baked and we love garlic, so I actually added two well-chopped cloves to the mix.

3. Leave out the lettuce.

4. Mix up the well-spun, salted tomato ""guts"" with the chopped bacon, chopped garlic, bread cubes, mayo, salt and pepper. Stuff your tomato shells, brush with the bacon drippings, and bake.

5. Don't eat these when they are scaldingly-hot. There is no flavor whatsoever, even if your mouth can handle extreme temperature. Either let the tomatoes rest for about ten minutes before serving, or cut the very hot tomatoes open a bit to let them cool for about five minutes, to what I would call ""very warm""--above room temperature, but not too hot. The flavors really seem to emerge as these stuffed tomatoes cool slightly ...But don't eat these cold, either. The many layers of flavors are a bit elusive, so give it a try on the warm side, and let it cool a little more if your taste buds aren't enjoying the dish yet :)

Last, we are thinking to add a bit more to this mix when we try it again, maybe some cut up rotisserie chicken?",3.3 of 5 stars

The flavor was so savory with the overnight rest with all of the freshly ground spices on the ribs.  A delicious change from the usual bbq'd baby back ribs.  They were also nicely tender.

Baby Potatoes with Creamy Goat Cheese and Fine Herbs,If you choose tiny potatoes for a single mouthful your guests will really enjoy and appreciate this recipe. The tarragon is the star of this combination although the sweetness of the potatoes and the sharpness of the creamy filling are right behind the tarragon.

I used walnuts instead of pecans and dried thyme instead of fresh but otherwise did not make any changes to the recipe.

The spring mix added great color to the salad as well as some nice different texture and flavors. A delightfully creamy goat cheese (I used Cypress Grove goat cheese I found at Whole Foods and the still warm toasted pecans added to the top of the salad along with the dried cranberries made this an immediate hit with some very picky salad eaters.

"Baby Spinach Salad with Roasted Red Onions, Pecans, Dried Cranberries, Crumbled Goat Cheese and Citrus Dressing","This was SO good; my new favorite spinach salad. I made it to bring to friends' house for dinner last night and none was left. The roasted onions are an excellent touch. The proportion of all the other ingredients, and the yummy dressing, were just right. Using good quality baby spinach is important.

I used the chopsticks yesterday, but today used 2 wooden spoons instead to stop myself from cutting all the way through - left a little more attached. I also learned that you want them to be nice and stable on your cookie sheet, so if they tend to rock, cut a small slice off the bottom to stabilize them. Made 4 of them yesterday (good sized russets), FOOLISHLY thinking I'd have some left over for today.

Bacon Hasselback Potatoes,"Yup, it's amazing. I placed two table knives on each side of the potato to keep my knife from cutting too far down. I scaled this recipe back for just 2 people... I recommend 1 slice of bacon per potato, and just halve the butter + fixings (why is it when you scale back a recipe, you always still more sauce than is mathematically correct?!?).",4.9 of 5 stars
Bacon Hasselback Potatoes,"The flavors are very good and go well with variety of meat types.
Preparation of spuds...initially, I followed the recipe's instructions. I kept cutting through the potato while slicing! After many trials...I used some common kitchen tools: chop sticks and butter slicers!
After prepping the potatoes, I put two chop sticks on the cutting board...placed the potato between...then used the butter slicer to slice even-width slices to the chop sticks. Works every time...for me!
This recipe makes delicious spuds!

""Arrange 5 strips of the bacon in parallel rows on a baking sheet, the edges of the slices touching but not overlapping...under to form a lattice.""  
""Bake the bacon lattice and the eggs until the bacon is just starting to crisp and the eggs are still jiggly in the center but slightly set, about 15 minutes.    
Use two spatulas to lift the bacon lattice and place it on top of the eggs.""",5 of 5 stars

Bacon Pinto Beans,Excellent recipe my fam absolutely loves it!,4.8 of 5 stars
Bacon Pinto Beans,I have made this recipe a few times and my whole family loves it. I make it just as written. I also took the advice of one reviewer and chop my bacon very small. ,4.8 of 5 stars
Bacon Pinto Beans,"Wonderful. Addictive. Have it for breakfast even. Make sure your chilli powder is good and fresh, as it will make all the difference; I also cut out a cup of water because it thickened up nicer with a richer flavor that way without hurting the cooking of the beans.",4.8 of 5 stars
Bacon Pinto Beans,I love this recipe..it is easy and full of flavor!  Wonderful with warmed tortillas or cornbread! ,4.8 of 5 stars
Bacon Pinto Beans,"These were very tasty, and were even better after an overnight mellowing in the fridge. The recipe does not call for sautéing the bacon before adding it to the beans, so I would advise chopping the bacon very finely so you do not end up with big hunks of fat in the final product.",4.8 of 5 stars

Bacon and Scallion Coleslaw,Pretty tasty and a very filling with the meat and other veggies. My boyfriend also liked this and he does not like coleslaw. Use Hellman's or Best Foods brand mayo if you want less sweet/tangy flavor and rinse cabbage well or it will be to salty.  ,4 of 5 stars
Bacon-Corn Relish,Great! Turns a lame hotdog into something amazing. We were scooping it up with tortilla chips at one point bc it's so tasty. Yum!,5 of 5 stars
