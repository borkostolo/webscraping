Kalamata Olive Tapenade,"This actually needed some rescuing from itself. The 1/2 cup olive oil is SO excessive! I literally had to sop up the excess olive oil with 5 paper towels that got completely saturated from the olive oil that was pooling on top.

After the olive oil mess got fixed, though, it was pretty good tapenade. I used feta on top instead of chervil and it was quite good.",4.3 of 5 stars
Kalamata Olive Tapenade,I made this for a party and received rave reviews! It is simple to make and has a delicious flavor. Everyone wanted to know what was in it. It will become a party staple. Don't let the anchovies scare you. They add a great flavor and don't taste fishy at all.,4.3 of 5 stars
