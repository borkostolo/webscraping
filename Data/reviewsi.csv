Ice Cream Crunch Cake,"Simple and yet impressive and delicious! As long as you have the freezer space and the time to freeze between layers, this is a winner. The only change I made was that I used crushed Oreos, mixed with some chocolate ganache and it came out great!",4.6 of 5 stars

Ice Cream Crunch Cake,"We loved this recipe. I used only 2 cartons of ice cream (one each of chocolate and vanilla) in order to fit my pan. I also used crushed cookies and chocolate syrup instead of magic shell because that's what we had. The cake came out perfectly. I had no trouble with it melting before serving. I wrapped the outside bottom of the springform pan in plastic wrap, and parchment on the inside. I froze the first ice cream layer for an hour and a half, till firm, and froze the second layer overnight. I pulled the cake out an hour before serving, and ran a hot knife around the inside, popped it out, and frosted the cake with whipped cream and topped with sprinkles. I put it back in the freezer for 30-45 min till firm and then we cut it to serve. Had NO problems with it melting. I'm thinking that those who did might not have made sure each layer was frozen before moving on. My advice is this... Don't scrimp on the brand of ice cream. Since this ""cake"" is almost ALL ice cream, splurge on the good stuff. ",4.6 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Crunch Cake,"Loved this cake, tasted just like C*rv*l cake! Next time I will use a larger pan, the 9-inch pan did not hold all of the ice cream in the recipe. It will also allow the chocolate crunch layer to be spread thinner. Made this for one son's birthday, another one of my sons requested it for his bday in a few weeks. Also, super easy to make as long as you plan ahead for the time allowed. I put it in my deep freezer, which sped up the time required to harden.",4.6 of 5 stars

Ice Cream Crunch Cake,"Good but don't add the chocolate shell topping, it gets hard as a rock and made it impossible to cut, really would have been better with out.",4.6 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Crunch Cake,I have found if you also add hot fudge sauce (I like the Hershey's Special Dark) to the cookies and hardshell it makes it so much easier to cut through!,4.6 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Crunch Cake,"Pretty good recipe here but it's hard to keep the ice cream from melting all over the place, especially after you remove it from the springform pan.",4.6 of 5 stars

Ice Cream Flag Cake,"Just finished making this cake for the second year. How the heck do you get that blue? Maybe it's the brand of food coloring? Cause with 2 different brands now I gotten a sick green. If I make it again, I'll leave out the cocoa, and I'll use a smaller springform pan for thicker stripes. One hint that worked well is having a circular smooth paddle (that can be reversed to a tenderizer size) - from Pampered Chef. That really allowed me to have the sorbet and ice cream more solid when spreading it out. Fun family ""project""",3.3 of 5 stars

Ice Cream Flag Cake,"I should have known better. I've made ice cream cakes before with no problem. However sherbet melts twice as fast as ice cream and using this as a bottom layer in a spring form pan? Mine started to melt and ooze through the bottom of the pan before I was finished spreading it.
Should have used cake as a bottom layer. And please, in between layers place it back in the fridge for at least an hour if not longer.
I left mine in the freezer overnight to frost it this morning. Took me less than 1 minute and placed it back in the freezer. I know when I cut into it, it won't even come close to resembling the cake in the photo.
My advice, after lining the spring form pan with parchment, place it on a cookie sheet and put the whole thing in the freezer for 30 min. to 1 hour before assembling.",3.3 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Flag Cake,"I made this with my 9 year old for the 4th of July, it came out great. Guests were very impressed with the presentation and the taste. Didn't have violet food coloring on hand so the blue was a little light more greenish. We followed the directions and used quality ice cream and raspberry sorbetto. Delicious!",3.3 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Flag Cake,I made this for the 4th of July. It was a disaster. It did not even turn out the way it was supposed to. The looks of the cake in the picture look a lot better than the outcome. I think the Cocoa ruined the cake.,3.3 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Flag Cake,The dessert is a great idea and will no doubt be delicious but I had to take away two stars for the recipe. DO NOT use the cocoa. I followed these directions but it created a slate gray cake. I left out the cocoa from the second cake and it worked beautifully.,3.3 of 5 stars
Ice Cream Maker Margaritas,Definitely gonna give this a try,5 of 5 stars
