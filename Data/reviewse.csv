Edamame and Miso Dip,This recipe was awful. Please donâ€™t waste your time or money (fairly pricey by the time u get the special ingredients). Truly one of the worst recipes I have tried. My husband thought so as well,3 of 5 stars
Edamame and Miso Dip,"Great recipe and is really good for dipping carrots, celery, cucumbers, bell peppers, and different types of crackers. Sesame crackers go really well with it. I added a bit of pink Himalayan salt while cooking the edamame, which enhanced some of the flavors. I also added one more garlic clove because I like a stronger garlic flavor. It was a huge hit at our get together!",3 of 5 stars

Edible Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,"Interesting. Still not as good as the real deal but no eggs either so that's good. I made to make homemade cookie dough ice cream. The recipe should be reduced-no one can eat that much dough. Still for my use, I think it's decent. ",4 of 5 stars
Edible Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,So I used it in ice cream and it is excellent! I should have used mini chips but the regular morsels are fine. ,4 of 5 stars
